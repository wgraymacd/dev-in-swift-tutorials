Part 1:

Reflect on the concepts:
Swift provides a fantastic selection of types to represent the data in the apps you create – String for written language, Int for numbers, and Array for ordered collections, to name a few. As your app gets more complex, you’ll sometimes use these built-in Swift types as building blocks to create your own types to represent the data in your app. Using custom types to represent real-world concepts is referred to as data modeling.

Topics and skills covered:
Creating a Swift file – a file without a view
Creating structures and modeling an app’s state as data by defining your own struct type
Using UUID to conform to Identifiable
Creating a grid layout with Grid and GridRow

Part 2:

Reflect on the concepts:
Unit tests are a great way to make sure your app does what you expect it to. Having a set of small, focused tests can help you find bugs early, when they’re easiest to fix.
This technique becomes especially powerful when you design custom types that handle the important business logic of your app. Creating custom types for core parts of your app’s logic lets you write tests that prove they do what they’re supposed to. Then you can use those types in your app, just as you did in your tests, and be confident that your app works as intended.

Topics and skills covered:
Adding a Unit Test Bundle target
Declaring enumerations with enum
Creating a type to contain your app’s logic
Using .opacity to hide views
Using .disabled to disable controls
Running tests and reading their output
