Reflect on the concepts:
In Alphabetizer, you combined many of the concepts from earlier tutorials: You created data models and detail views. You created a type to hold app data and logic.
@Observable gives you the power to define your own data models separate from SwiftUI views. You learned how to power SwiftUI with classes and how to share them. Separating your code into data models and views makes it easier to reason about how the app works.
