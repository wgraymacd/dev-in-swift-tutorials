Reflect on the concepts:
Models
Models represent an app’s state outside the view hierarchy, even across launches. You now have another powerful tool for assembling complex applications. Almost all apps use persistence of some form, and you know one way to make that happen.
Frameworks
The SwiftData framework provides tools to connect SwiftUI to storage.
SwiftData won’t be the only framework you import in your projects. There are a variety of frameworks available to support a wide range of app functionality. Here are some examples:
- Swift Charts provides powerful data visualization
- Contacts offers access to contacts
- PhotoKit facilitates access to stored photos and videos
